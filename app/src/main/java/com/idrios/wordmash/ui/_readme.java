/**
 items in the 'ui' group are elements the user can see. This includes board layout, list layout,
 corresponding tiles, popups, and other front-end things. Classes in this package listen for
 user interaction and then relay event information through the eventbus to the engine. Other than
 programmatically organizing the layout, classes in the ui package do not execute any functions
 of their own.
