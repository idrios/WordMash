 items in the 'events' group are related to the events themselves. Events that are are a result of
 user interaction (tapping a tile; pressing 'back'; pressing 'rearrange') fall into a 'ui' subgroup.
 Events that are a result of in-game logic (check the spelling of a word; time runs out) fall into
 an 'engine' subgroup. All events are handled by the engine

 EventObserver serves as an inferface to attach with fragment activities.
 Events themselves carry information relevant to fire the event.
 The EventBus listens for events and carries them to the Engine when they occur.
